 Game

Unity 5-----------------------------
-I completed having the characters be controlled by WASD and IJKL respectably.
-Got Jumping set up
-Second player and Main player both have scores that operate correctly off of jumping above the other's head.
-Colliders all work correctly with out error.





Unity 6--------------------------------

-Points work correctly for both players and a winner is reached at 4 points.
The UI updates correctly and the game freezes and displays a winner when the win condition is met.
